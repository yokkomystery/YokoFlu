# {{APP_NAME}}

A new Flutter project.

> ## ⚡ Quick Start
>
> Check [`TODO.md`](TODO.md) for setup steps. Japanese version: [`TODO_ja.md`](TODO_ja.md)
>
> It includes:
>
> - ✅ Firebase setup (enable Firestore, security rules, auth)
> - ✅ App configuration (links, store IDs, content updates)
> - ✅ Test & build verification
> - ✅ Store submission prep
>
> Once all checkboxes are done, you're ready for production!

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook)

For help getting started with Flutter development, view the
[online documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.

## Flutter Build Commands

### Development

```bash
# Debug build
flutter build apk --debug
flutter build ios --debug

# Release build
flutter build apk --release
flutter build ios --release
```

{{#ENVIRONMENT_SEPARATION}}

### Environment-specific builds (when separation is enabled)

#### Run (flutter run)

```bash
# Staging Environment
flutter run --flavor staging --dart-define=ENVIRONMENT=staging
flutter run --flavor staging --dart-define=ENVIRONMENT=staging --release

# Production Environment
flutter run --flavor production --dart-define=ENVIRONMENT=production
flutter run --flavor production --dart-define=ENVIRONMENT=production --release
```

#### Build (flutter build)

```bash
# Staging Environment (Development/Testing)
flutter build apk --flavor staging --dart-define=ENVIRONMENT=staging --debug
flutter build apk --flavor staging --dart-define=ENVIRONMENT=staging --release
flutter build ipa --flavor staging --dart-define=ENVIRONMENT=staging --release

# Production Environment (Release)
flutter build apk --flavor production --dart-define=ENVIRONMENT=production --debug
flutter build apk --flavor production --dart-define=ENVIRONMENT=production --release
flutter build ipa --flavor production --dart-define=ENVIRONMENT=production --release
```

#### Store release builds

```bash
# Play Store (AAB)
flutter build appbundle --flavor production --dart-define=ENVIRONMENT=production --release

# App Store (IPA)
flutter build ipa --flavor production --dart-define=ENVIRONMENT=production --release
```

**How iOS environments work:**

- Uses Xcode schemes created by this tool: `staging` / `production`
- `--flavor` selects the scheme; Debug/Release controls build mode
- `.xcconfig` files contain Bundle ID and app name
{{#FIREBASE_ENABLED}}
- `--dart-define=ENVIRONMENT=xxx` can explicitly select Firebase config files
{{/FIREBASE_ENABLED}}

### Why Android and iOS Commands Differ

**Android**:

- Uses **Product Flavors** (fully supported by Flutter)
- `--flavor staging|production` → switches Bundle ID and app name
- `--dart-define=ENVIRONMENT=xxx` → tells Firebase config script which files to use

**iOS**:

- Uses Xcode **Schemes** and **Build Configurations** generated by this tool
- `--flavor staging|production` → selects the scheme (and its `.xcconfig`)
- Debug/Release → controls build mode
- `.xcconfig` files contain Bundle ID and app name
- `--dart-define=ENVIRONMENT=xxx` can be used to explicitly select Firebase config files

**Result**: Both achieve the same goal (environment separation), but use platform-specific best practices.

## Xcode Build Script

Added automatically by this tool. Make sure the "Firebase Config Script" build phase exists.

## Environment Setup

### Firebase configuration files

- `ios/Runner/GoogleService-Info-staging.plist` - for Staging
- `ios/Runner/GoogleService-Info-production.plist` - for Production
- `android/app/google-services-staging.json` - for Staging
- `android/app/google-services-production.json` - for Production

### Environment variables

- `ENVIRONMENT=staging|production` - used to switch Firebase environments
  {{/FIREBASE_ENABLED}}

## Development Guide

### Initial Setup

```bash
# Get dependencies
flutter pub get

# Check environment
flutter doctor
```

### Add dependencies

```bash
flutter pub add <package_name>
```

### Upgrade dependencies

```bash
flutter pub upgrade
```

### Clean build

```bash
flutter clean && flutter pub get
```

### Code generation (if using Freezed etc.)

```bash
dart run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
```

### Run tests

```bash
flutter test
```

### Lint

```bash
flutter analyze
```
